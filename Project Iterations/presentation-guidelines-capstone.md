  - Access the deployed application via public EC2 or domain
  - Demonstrate:
    - User login/register
    - Submit loan application
    - Manager reviewing and approving loans
    - Any DevOps elements (e.g., rebuild/deploy, Docker logs)
- **Tips:** Narrate key points during the walkthrough, and prepare fallback screenshots.

---

#### **Slide 10: Challenges**
- **Contents:**
  Reflect on challenges faced during Iteration 3 and explain how they were addressed. Here are some example to choose from, or create your own:

- **Time Management & Prioritization**
  - *Challenge:* Balancing project work with assignments, QC interviews, and interview prep limited focused development time.
  - *Solution:* The team used sprint planning to break DevOps tasks into smaller units and coordinated work around known time blocks. Shared calendars and clear delegation helped minimize blockers.

- **Docker Networking & Build Issues**
  - *Challenge:* Containers couldn't communicate properly or failed to build due to missing dependencies or port conflicts.
  - *Solution:* Teams used Docker’s custom bridge networks and ensured exposed ports matched the app’s config. Build errors were resolved by updating the Dockerfile and checking logs with `docker logs`.

- **IAM Role & Security Group Misconfigurations**
  - *Challenge:* EC2 couldn’t connect to RDS or access AWS services due to incorrect IAM roles or closed ports.
  - *Solution:* Teams adjusted RDS security groups to allow EC2 traffic, used IAM roles instead of hardcoded keys, and tested permissions using AWS IAM Policy Simulator.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins or Manual)**
  - *Challenge:* Jenkins pipelines (if used) failed due to incorrect credentials, build scripts, or environment variable issues.
  - *Solution:* Teams used `.env` files and Jenkins credentials manager (or shell scripts for manual pipelines). SSH access was set up for remote Docker deployment from GitHub.

- **Managing AWS Resources & Costs**
  - *Challenge:* EC2 or RDS usage exceeded the free tier, or instances were accidentally left running.
  - *Solution:* Teams used t2.micro EC2 instances and PostgreSQL in RDS with free tier eligibility. They stopped unused resources when not in use and switched to local testing where possible.

- **Front-End and Back-End Communication**
  - *Challenge:* React could not communicate with the deployed Spring Boot API, often due to CORS or endpoint config issues.
  - *Solution:* Added `@CrossOrigin` annotations in Spring or updated the CORS config. Ensured React pointed to the correct EC2 public IP via `.env` variables.

- **Learning Curve for DevOps Tools**
  - *Challenge:* Limited prior exposure to Docker, AWS, or Jenkins made setup and troubleshooting difficult.
  - *Solution:* Team members self-assigned learning roles, leveraged AWS and Docker documentation, and shared working configurations. Collaboration and shared docs improved team ramp-up.

  - Possible improvements for scalability and reliability:
    - Auto-scaling with ECS or Fargate
    - Load balancers for traffic management
    - Enhanced monitoring with AWS CloudWatch
    - Secrets management using AWS Secrets Manager or SSM
    - Fully managed CI/CD with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline

### **3. Additional Presentation Tips**

- **Rehearse:**  
  Test your deployment and make sure Docker, AWS, and Jenkins elements are working before the demo.

- **Visuals:**  
  Use diagrams and screenshots of Jenkins pipelines, AWS console, Docker commands, etc. Don’t overfill slides with text.

- **Roles & Teamwork:**  
  Assign sections of the presentation to team members based on who worked on which feature. Keep transitions smooth and professional.

- **Focus on CI/CD Goals:**  
  Even if Jenkins isn’t used, clearly show what parts of the build-deploy process were automated or streamlined.

- **Keep Security in Mind:**  
  Briefly explain how credentials were protected (e.g., using environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets).
