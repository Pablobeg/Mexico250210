    - Unit tests (using JUnit 5 and Mockito)
    - (Optional) Integration tests using Spring Boot’s test framework and MockMvc.
  - Describe logging configuration with Logback.
- **Visuals:** Graphs or simple flowcharts can help illustrate the testing flow.

#### **Slide 9: Live Demo**
- **Contents:**
  - Provide a live demonstration of:
    - User registration, login, and profile management.

### **3. Additional Presentation Tips**

- **Rehearse:**  
  Practice your presentation several times. Ensure the demo runs smoothly, and have backups (e.g., screenshots) in case of technical issues.

- **Visuals & Code Snippets:**  
  Use diagrams and screenshots to illustrate complex points. Avoid overloading slides with text; keep them clear and to the point.

- **Team Coordination:**  
  Divide the presentation into sections and assign team members to present their areas of responsibility. Ensure smooth transitions between speakers.

- **Engage the Audience:**  
  Encourage questions during the Q&A session. Speak clearly and confidently about both technical and non-technical aspects.

- **Time Management:**  
  Stick to the allotted 10–15 minutes, ensuring each section gets the necessary attention without rushing or dragging.

- **Feedback:**  
  End with a slide summarizing lessons learned and potential future enhancements to show ongoing improvement and vision.
